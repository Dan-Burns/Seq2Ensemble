!!! tldr "Welcome to Seq2Ensemble"

- Below you will find a set of Colab notebooks that form a computational piepline connecting primary sequence of proteins with the conformational ensembles which are consistent with the NMR data collected under specific external conditions.

- To learn more about Seq2Ensemble please refer to the upcoming manuscript by S Sedinkin et al.
